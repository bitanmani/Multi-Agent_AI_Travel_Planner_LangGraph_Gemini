# ✈️ AI Travel Planner: Multi-Agent System with LangGraph
🌟 Overview
The AI Travel Planner is a cutting-edge application that leverages the power of multi-agent AI systems and Google's Gemini 2.0 to transform travel planning from a tedious, hours-long process into an automated, intelligent experience. Built on LangGraph, the system coordinates seven specialized AI agents that work together to research destinations, analyze weather, find accommodations, calculate budgets, plan logistics, and create detailed day-by-day itineraries.
Why This Matters
Traditional travel planning involves:

📱 Switching between dozens of websites
⏰ Hours of research and comparison
🧩 Manually piecing together disconnected information
💸 Uncertainty about total costs
🗓️ Trial and error with schedules and routes

Solution: A single interface where AI agents collaborate to deliver a complete travel plan in 2-5 minutes.

🎯 Key Features
🤖 Multi-Agent Collaboration
Seven specialized AI agents working in harmony:

Advanced: Multi-City Planning
# Example: 10-day Italy tour
destination = "Italy (Rome & Florence & Venice)"
cities = ["Rome", "Florence", "Venice"]
num_days = 10
multi_city = True

# The system will:
# 1. Allocate days per city (e.g., 4-3-3)
# 2. Find intercity train/flight options
# 3. Create separate itineraries per city
# 4. Include travel days with lighter activities

Customization Options
Budget Ranges:

Budget-Friendly: $50-100/day per person
Mid-Range: $100-250/day per person
Luxury: $250-500+/day per person

Travel Styles:

Culture: Museums, historical sites, local traditions
Adventure: Hiking, water sports, extreme activities
Relaxation: Spas, beaches, slow-paced exploration
Family-Friendly: Kid-appropriate activities, safe areas
Luxury: Premium experiences, fine dining, boutique hotels
Budget Backpacking: Hostels, street food, free attractions

🔬 Technical Deep Dive
LangGraph State Machine
The system uses LangGraph's StateGraph to manage workflow:
class TravelPlannerState(TypedDict):
    # Input fields
    destination: str
    num_days: int
    interests: list
    
    # Agent outputs
    research_results: str
    weather_analysis: str
    final_itinerary: str
    
    # Control flow
    revision_count: int  # For cyclic behavior
    current_step: str

Key Innovation: Conditional Edges
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "planner",
    router_check,  # Evaluates data quality
    {
        "hotel": "hotel",          # Loop back if needed
        "activities": "activities"  # Proceed if satisfied
    }
)
Agent Design Pattern
Each agent follows a consistent structure:
class TravelAgent:
    def __init__(self, name, role, system_prompt, api_key, temperature):
        self.llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(...)
        
    def invoke(self, messages, max_retries=2):
        # 1. Prepend system message
        # 2. Call Gemini with retry logic
        # 3. Return structured response
Temperature Settings:

Research/Weather/Logistics: 0.5-0.6 (factual accuracy)
Planner: 0.7 (balanced creativity)
Hotels/Activities: 0.6 (practical recommendations)

Tool Integration
Web Search (DuckDuckGo):
@tool
def web_search_tool(query: str, max_results: int = 6):
    # Returns: [{title, url, snippet}, ...]
    # Used by: Research, Hotel, Activities agents

Weather API (Open-Meteo):
@tool
def get_weather_forecast(destination: str, start_date: str, num_days: int):
    # Returns: {location, forecast: [{date, temp, conditions}]}
    # Used by: Weather agent

🎓 How It Works: Step-by-Step
Phase 1: Initialization (0.5s)

User submits form
